# DisplayName
A user interface with two text input fields labeled 'First Name' and 'Last Name'. Implemented with a 'Submit' button functionality such that upon clicking, it displays the concatenated result of the entered name as 'Full Name' directly on the webpage, ensuring the output is visible to the user and not just logged to the console.
